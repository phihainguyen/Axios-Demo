# Axios-Demo

This web-app displays the different HTTP requests that axios, an HTTP library, has to offer. This web application shows the abilities and usage of axios, a powerful tool which allows the communication between frontend and backend, through these different types of request native to axios.

Through this simple UI that displays the different buttons at the top of the window, by clicking on each button the UI will display the different types of responses to the body corresponding the buttons that were clicked.

The UI shows the status of the different type of request, the data that comes back from the request, as well as the config. This web-app uses the JSONPlaceholder, which serves as the REST API, allowing us to use and display the different requests axios has to offer.
